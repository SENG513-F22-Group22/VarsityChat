# VarsityChatters.io

## Project Proposal
We propose a proprietary chat application that will be sold to post-secondary schools. This web-app will allow students to text-chat with one another. Students would find each other through their school emails; which are required to create a user account, or through mutual classes they are currently enrolled in. This application will make it easier for students to make friends, and to collaborate in order to further their studies. Our objectives are to create a mobile-first interface that will allow one-on-one persistent communication between students, to provide methods for students to be able to connect with colleagues in mutual classes, and to create an intuitive interface that simplifies the student search process with fast and responsive features. These objectives will live in a hub that primarily shows current conversations and a call to action to find other students.

## Info
- `server` contains all backend code (NodeJS, ExpressJS)
- `client` contains all frontend code (ReactJS)

## Installing and running Node
For those that have not developed node applications before: to run the application locally:
1. Clone the repo
2. `git checkout -b your-name/your-feature` to create and switch to your own branch
3. `cd client`
4. `npm install` to install client dependencies
5. `npm start` to run the react app
6. `cd ../server`
7. `npm install` to install server dependencies
8. `npm start` to run the express server
9. Experiment with the code to see how things work
