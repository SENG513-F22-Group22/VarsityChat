## Project Proposal
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sD819a7_4Zo-hMr9_804emo1XnkX0FCMvIyLQHQ0u-I/edit

## Info
- `server` contains all backend code (NodeJS, ExpressJS)
- `client` contains all frontend code (ReactJS)

## Installing and running Node
For those that have not developed node applications before: to run the application locally:
1. Clone the repo
2. `git checkout -b your-name/your-feature` to create and switch to your own branch
3. `cd client`
4. `npm install` to install client dependencies
5. `npm start` to run the react app
6. `cd ../server`
7. `npm install` to install server dependencies
8. `npm start` to run the express server
9. Experiment with the code to see how things work
